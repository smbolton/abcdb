<p>The database currently contains:</p>
<ul>
<li>{{ songs }} songs</li>
<li>{{ instances }} song instances</li>
<li>{{ titles }} titles</li>
<li>{{ collections }} collections</li>
</ul>
<p>Instances vs. songs deduplication amount: {{ dedup_percent }}%</p>

<p>In the following table, the instances of each song are counted, then those
counts are tabulated to show the frequency of occurrence of each count.
Counts greater than 1 reflect successful identification of "musically
identical" instances of the same song.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Instances-per-Song Count</th><th>Frequency</th></tr>
{% for c, n in inst_per_song_histo %}
  <tr><td>{{ c }}</td><td>{{ n }}</td>
{% endfor %}
</table>

<p>Similarly, the following table shows the frequency of occurrence of
collections per instance. Counts greater than 1 reflect instances which
were found in more than one collection, representing successful deduplication
at the instance level.</p>
<table>
<tr><th>Collections-per-Instance Count</th><th>Frequency</th></tr>
{% for c, n in coll_per_inst_histo %}
  <tr><td>{{ c }}</td><td>{{ n }}</td>
{% endfor %}
</table>
