ABCdb is a web-based tool for working with music notated in ABC
format, providing database, deduplication, rendering, and analysis functions.

Documentation
=============

You may read the full documentation on `Read the Docs
<http://abcdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project_description.html>`_.

Installation
============

ABCdb is a fairly straightforward Django project. It requires the following
packages:

  * `Python 3.5 <https://www.python.org/>`_
  * `Django 1.10 <https:/www.djangoproject.com/>`_
  * `pytz 2016.10 <https://pythonhosted.org/pytz/>`_
  * `requests 2.12.5 <https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests>`_
  * `Arpeggio 1.5 <https://github.com/igordejanovic/Arpeggio>`_
  * `graphviz 0.5.2 <https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz>`_, as well as the
    `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_ binaries.

Additionally, two environment variables must be set:

  * ``ABCDB_SECRET_KEY`` - Set this to the database key.

  * ``ABCDB_DEPLOYMENT`` - Set this to either 'development' or 'production'.
    The ``settings.DEBUG`` value is set based on this, ``True`` for
    'development' and ``False`` for 'production'. When using 'production', you
    will need to do more configuration in ``settings``, such as setting
    ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` and other security settings.

A simple demonstration installation, using the Django development server, can be made something
like this:

.. code:: shell

   $ virtualenv abcdb-test
   $ cd abcdb-test
   $ source ./bin/activate
   $ git clone https://github.com/smbolton/abcdb.git abcdb
   $ cd abcdb
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   $ export ABCDB_SECRET_KEY='somE_secreT_databasE_keY'
   $ export ABCDB_DEPLOYMENT='development'
   $ python manage.py makemigrations
   $ python manage.py migrate
   $ python manage.py createsuperuser --username=admin --email=none@example.com  # will ask for password
   $ python manage.py runserver

Point your browser at the development server URL (http://127.0.0.1:8000/ by default), and log in
as 'admin' to access all ABCdb functions. See the
`Usage <http://abcdb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/project_description.html#usage>`_ section of the
documentation for details.
